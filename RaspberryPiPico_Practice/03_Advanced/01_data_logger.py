Raspberry Pi Pico - Advanced Program 1: Data Logger
==================================================

This program demonstrates how to create a data logger that records
sensor readings to a file on the Pico's filesystem with timestamps.

Hardware required:
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- DHT22 or DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- DS3231 RTC (Real-Time Clock) module
- microSD card module (SPI interface)
- 10K ohm resistor (for DHT sensor)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Optional: LED for status indication

Connections:
- DHT sensor:
  - Connect VCC to 3.3V
  - Connect GND to GND
  - Connect DATA to GPIO pin 15
  - Connect a 10K resistor between DATA and VCC (pull-up)

- DS3231 RTC module:
  - Connect VCC to 3.3V
  - Connect GND to GND
  - Connect SDA to GPIO pin 16 (I2C0 SDA)
  - Connect SCL to GPIO pin 17 (I2C0 SCL)

- microSD card module:
  - Connect VCC to 3.3V
  - Connect GND to GND
  - Connect MISO to GPIO pin 4 (SPI0 RX)
  - Connect MOSI to GPIO pin 7 (SPI0 TX)
  - Connect SCK to GPIO pin 6 (SPI0 SCK)
  - Connect CS to GPIO pin 5 (SPI0 CSn)

- Optional: Connect an LED to GPIO pin 25 through a 220 ohm resistor

Note: You'll need to install the following libraries:
- dht.py for the DHT sensor
- ds3231.py for the RTC module
- sdcard.py for the microSD card

Instructions:
1. Set up the circuit as described above
2. Upload the required libraries to your Pico
3. Upload this program to the Pico
4. The program will log temperature and humidity data to a CSV file
5. You can remove the microSD card and view the data on a computer

Concepts covered:
- File I/O operations
- Real-time clock integration
- SD card interfacing with SPI
- Structured data storage (CSV format)
- Error handling and recovery
- Power-efficient logging with sleep
